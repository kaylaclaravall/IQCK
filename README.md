# IQCK: Functional Annotation and Visual Investigation

* This project utilises meta-visualisation of the big data generated from the world's largest GWAS of late-onset Alzheimer's disease to assist in the functional annotation of novel SNPs (reference study doi: 10.1038/s41588-019-0358-2).
* Of the five newly discovered genome-wide loci **(IQCK, ACE, ADAM10, ADAMTS1, and WWOX)**, this project is investigating the putative function of **IQCK** using meta-visualisation and other bioinformatics methods.
